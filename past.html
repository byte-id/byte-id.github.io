                <p>I'm from Norway. My city is considered one of the larger ones, but only holds around 200k people. Norway is renowned for its nature, and is sort of amazing, but I'm used to it and enjoy the climate here more, so far at least. 10 yea There is 10 years of mandatory school, and then usually 3 years of high school if you're planning to go to uni or something similar to tafe if you want to do something more practical.

                <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>I graduated high school in June 2022. At my high school you chose to focus on either STEM or social subjects. I had an IT subject in high school, but it wasn't too exciting, as my interest in the subject lies more on backend rather than design and frontend. The table shows what electives I had in STEM. The points from STEM subjects are applied to your weighted grade.

                <h2>Folk High School</h2>
                <p>Since this is my first year of uni, I had a gap year in between, going to what would be translated as "folk high school". It's a sort of boarding school, but you can basically choose to do whatever you want, like extreme sports, arts, animation, film etc. and there are no grades. It's a year for enjoyment where the main purpose is socialising and learning about other people and not least of all yourself. Last year I was flying glider planes. You heard right, like a pilot. I did about 2/3 of the program, but didn't have time to finish it, since you mainly fly during summer when it’s warmer. Some of my classmates ended up getting their certificate: PPL(A) - Private pilot licence (aeroplane).
